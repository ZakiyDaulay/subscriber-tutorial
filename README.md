## What is AMQP? ##

AMQP stands for Advanced Message Queuing Protocol.
It is an open standard protocol for message-oriented middleware. AMQP allows applications to communicate with each other by sending messages through queues, and it also decouples the sender and receiver. 



## What does this mean: guest:guest@localhost:5672? ##
The first guest is the username.The second guest is the password. localhost refers to your local machine. 
5672 is the default port that RabbitMQ uses for AMQP connections.
